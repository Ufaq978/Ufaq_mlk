**Bookkeeper**

Hello! Ufaq M. Call me Evelyn (name for client easement). I really enjoy bookkeeping because I love working with numbers. It makes me happy. I have an MBA in Accounting & Finance and have been doing bookkeeping for clients for more than 8 years. Also, I know QuickBooks Online really well because I'm a certified expert. I've worked a lot with other tools too, like Gusto, PayPal, Stripe, Square, Bill.com, Dext, Google Sheets, and Excel.
